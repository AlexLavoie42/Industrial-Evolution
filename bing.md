Adding more types of resources, goods, and assemblies that have different properties and uses. For example, there could be resources that are rare, volatile, toxic, or renewable. There could also be goods that are luxury, essential, seasonal, or illegal. There could also be assemblies that are modular, upgradeable, customizable, or experimental.
Incorporating more elements of strategy and competition. For example, there could be rival factories that compete with the player for resources, market share, and contracts. There could also be environmental factors (such as weather, pollution, disasters, etc.) that affect the production and demand of goods. There could also be political and social events (such as wars, strikes, protests, etc.) that influence the market and the workers.
Exploring more themes and emotions related to industrialization and capitalism. For example, the game could show the impact of the playerâ€™s factory on the environment and the society. There could be ethical dilemmas (such as exploiting workers, dumping waste, bribing officials, etc.) that the player has to face. There could also be moral choices (such as supporting or opposing social movements, investing in research or charity, etc.) that the player has to make.

Some possible ways to expand the core gameplay loop are:

- Add more types of Power and Work, such as Solar, Wind, Nuclear, etc. Each type of Power could have different advantages and disadvantages, such as cost, reliability, environmental impact, etc.
- Add more types of Assemblies that require different combinations of Power, Work, Resources and Goods. For example, a Printing Press could require Paper, Ink and Mechanical Work to produce Books.
- Add more types of Resources and Goods that have different qualities and values. For example, Wood could have different grades, such as Oak, Pine, Bamboo, etc. Paper could have different types, such as Recycled, Glossy, Colored, etc.
- Add more types of Workers that have different skills and personalities. For example, a Mechanic could repair broken Assemblies faster, but a Lazy Worker could slack off and cause errors more often.
- Add more types of Market events that affect the supply and demand of Resources and Goods. For example, a War could increase the demand for Weapons and decrease the demand for Luxury Goods.
- Add more types of Factory events that affect the production and operation of the Factory. For example, a Fire could damage or destroy some Assemblies and Goods, but a Safety Inspection could improve the reliability and efficiency of the Factory.
- Add more types of Goals and Challenges that give the player a sense of direction and progression. For example, a Contract could require the player to produce a certain amount of Goods within a deadline, but a Rival Factory could compete with the player for market share and resources.

- **Items**:
    - **Coal**: A resource that can be mined and used as fuel for thermal power and heat-based assemblies.
    - **Iron**: A resource that can be mined and smelted into metal for various goods and equipment.
    - **Steel**: A good that can be produced by combining iron and coal in a blast furnace. It is stronger and more durable than iron.
    - **Cotton**: A resource that can be harvested from plants and used to make textiles and clothing.
    - **Fabric**: A good that can be produced by spinning cotton in a spinning wheel or a spinning jenny. It can be used to make clothing and other goods.
    - **Clothing**: A good that can be produced by weaving fabric in a loom or a power loom. It can be sold for profit or used by workers.
- **Assemblies**:
    - **Blast Furnace**: An assembly that requires coal, iron and thermal work to produce steel. It has a high reliability but also a high environmental impact.
    - **Spinning Jenny**: An assembly that requires cotton and mechanical work to produce fabric. It has a low reliability but also a low cost.
    - **Power Loom**: An assembly that requires fabric, electrical work and mechanical work to produce clothing. It has a high reliability but also a high cost.
    - **Steam Engine**: An assembly that requires coal, water and thermal work to produce mechanical work. It can be used to power other assemblies or vehicles.
    - **Railway**: An assembly that requires steel, wood and mechanical work to transport goods and workers between different locations. It has a high reliability but also a high maintenance cost.
